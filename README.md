# C-SFML-Breakout-Clone-Game
Breakout Clone attempts to replicate the classics 1976 ‘Breakout’ video game using the ‘Pong’ game featured in John Horton ‘Beginning C++ Game Programming’ book (published by Packt>) as a starting point.  Breakout Clone is coding in C++ and utilizes the SFML Library.

-----------------

RULES/GOAL:

The goal ‘Breakout Clone’ is to receive the highest score possible by destroying bricks and conquering levels. Bricks are destroyed upon contact with the ball. Every brick destroyed is worth Points! When all the bricks are destroyed, the level is conquered. The player will then move on to the next level. Each new level becomes more challenging than the last as the ball moves faster.
A destroyed brick is worth 10 points on the first level. The value of each brick will increase by 5 points per level. Thus, bricks on Level 2 are worth 15 points each; on level 3, they are worth 20 points; on level 4, they are 25 points and so forth.

HOW TO PLAY:

Move Paddle Left = 'Left' Arrow Key

Move Paddle Right = 'Right' Arrow Key
